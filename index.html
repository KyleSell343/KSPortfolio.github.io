                <h3> An Intermediate Guide to the EF-24G | VTOLVR </h3>
                <p class="ProjectDescription">
                    This guide was a video made to show the visual and auditory cues and requirments to adequatly fly the EF-24G in a competitive VTOL VR environment. This video is a companion to my written guide.
                    After publishing the written guide for some time, I realized that many of the visual and auditory cues that are required to understand the flight systems are not adequately portrayed through text,
                    and wanted to create a guide that could better help to educate new player on those systems. Additionally, after writing the guide I found that many players were better able to understand the concepts displayed in these guides
                    through the audio/visusal mediums as opposed to text alone.

                <h3> Sneezy's PvP Guide for the EF-24G | VTOLVR </h3>
                <p class="ProjectDescription">
                    This guide is a technical guide that I made to help new players understand flight systems, weapon systems, and missile evasion techniques required to fly the EF-24G in VTOLVR.
                    These systems are technically and mechanically complex, and I wanted to create a guide that broke down those systems into easily digestible pieces for new players. 
                    I left this written guide as a companion to the video guide in place, as through text I am able to spend more time on technical details about systems without worrying about video length or pacing.
                    A written guide can also be continuously updated as new information comes to light, game systems change, or as I get more feedback on the quality of the guide.

                <h3> Godot Star Map </h3>
                <p class="ProjectDescription">
                   This project is a simple rotating map of nearby stars built within the Godot Engine. The purpose of this project was to learn the Godot Engine and GDScript language. Each stars position in 3D space is determined by it’s actual coordinates in light years from our sun,
                   as well as its position in our night sky. Coordinates are converted from spherical to cartesian coordinates to be placed in 3D space, with its properties light color and magnitude assigned at runtime. The data on these stars was pulled from a publicly available chart
                   of local stars from Wikipedia. The code and systems I wrote to make this project are publicly available on github, linked below. <br>

                <h3> Java Lunar Lander Recreation </h3>
                <p class="ProjectDescription">
                   Written in Java, with use of the JavaFX library, this project recreated the classic game Lunar Lander. I used several piecewise polynomial functions to model the terrain, so that vertical hit detection of the 
                   lander module would be pixel-perfect to the displayed terrain. <br>
